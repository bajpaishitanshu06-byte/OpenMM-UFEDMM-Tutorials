# OpenMM-UFEDMM-Tutorials
OpenMM molecular dynnamics engine combined with UFEDMM give access to run to different enhanced sampling techniques like Temperature Accelerated Molecular dynamics or driven Adibatic free energy dynamics (TAMD/d-AFED), unified free energy dynamics (UFED), Temperature acclerated sliced sampling (TASS). Here in this tutorial we are going to demonstrate how to run this methods OpenMM-UFEDMM module.  

### TAMD/d-AFED 
### UFED
### TASS
